Since we're talking about sets of natural numbers, which do not have extra structure beyond their membership relations, an isomorphism in this case would just be a bijection.\\n\\nLet $\\\\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and $\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathbb{N}$ be the disjoint union of two copies of the set of natural numbers.\\n\\nConsider the function $f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathbb{N}$ defined as follows:\\n\\n$f(n) = \\\\begin{cases}\\n1\\\\cdot n/2 & \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is even} \\\\\\\\\\n2\\\\cdot(n-1)/2 & \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is odd}\\n\\\\end{cases}$\\n\\nIn simpler terms, this function maps each even natural number $n$ to the first copy of $\\\\mathbb{N}$, and it maps each odd number to the second copy of $\\\\mathbb{N}$.\\n\\nWe now need to prove that this function is a bijection:\\n\\n1. **Injective (One-to-one)**:\\n\\nAssume $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$. If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both even, then $n_1/2 = n_2/2$, which implies that $n_1 = n_2$. Similarly, if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both odd, then $(n_1-1)/2 = (n_2-1)/2$, which also implies that $n_1 = n_2$. It is clear that an even natural number cannot equal an odd natural number, hence the function is injective.\\n\\n2. **Surjective (Onto)**:\\n\\nFor every $m$ in the first copy of $\\\\mathbb{N}$, $2m$ is an even number in $\\\\mathbb{N}$ that maps to $m$. Similarly, for every $m$ in the second copy of $\\\\mathbb{N}$, $2m+1$ is an odd number in $\\\\mathbb{N}$ that maps to $m$. Hence, every element of $\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathbb{N}$ has a preimage in $\\\\mathbb{N}$, and the function is surjective.\\n\\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection and hence an isomorphism between $\\\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the set of natural numbers $\\\\mathbb{N}$ is isomorphic to the disjoint union $\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\sqcup \\\\mathbb{N}$.\"}\n",

We will show that the statement \"every section $s : X \\\\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\\n\\nCounter-example: Let $X = \\\\{0,1\\\\}$ and define $f : X \\\\to X$ by $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$. Then $f$ is involutive, since $f(f(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(f(1)) = f(0) = 1$. \\n\\nNow, we will show that there are two sections of $f$: the identity function $id_X$ and $f$ itself. \\n\\nFirst, let $id_X : X \\\\to X$ be the identity function, defined by $id_X(x) = x$ for all $x \\\\in X$. We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\\\circ id_X = id_X$.\\n\\nSecond, let $s : X \\\\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$. We can see that $s$ is also a section of $f$ by checking that $f(s(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(s(1)) = f(0) = 1$, which implies that $s$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\\\circ s = s$.\\n\\nHowever, $id_X$ and $f$ are not equal, since $id_X(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$. Therefore, not every section of $f$ is equal to $f$. \\n\\nThus, we have shown that the statement \"every section $s : X \\\\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\\nTEMPLATE CODE:\\n```coq\\nFrom Coq Require Import ssr.ssrfun.\\n\\nLemma counter_example : exists X (f : X -> X),\\n  involutive f /\\\\\\n  exists s : X -> X, cancel f s /\\\\ s <> f.\\nProof.

We expect the term \"2 * (n / 2)\" to be rewritten to \"n\" when 'n' is even, but this term is in the form \"a * (b / c)\" which doesn't fit the pattern \"a * b / b\".\n",
