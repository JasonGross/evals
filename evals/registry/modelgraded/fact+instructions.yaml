  prompt: |-
    You are comparing a submitted answer to an expert answer on a given question, with specific instructions about how to answer. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Expert]: {ideal}
    ************
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ************
    [END DATA]

    First evaluate whether or not the submitted answer followed all instructions in the question.
    Then, only if the submitted answer followed all instructions correctly, compare the factual content of the submitted answer with the expert answer. Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.
    The submitted answer may either fail to follow all instructions, or it may be a subset or superset of the expert answer, or it may conflict with it. Determine which case applies. Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:
    (I) The submitted answer fails to follow the instructions in the question.
    (A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
    (B) The submitted answer is a superset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
    (C) The submitted answer contains all the same details as the expert answer.
    (D) There is a disagreement between the submitted answer and the expert answer.
    (E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter from the perspective of factuality.
